# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Week 1 - Introduction to Deep Learning

### What is a neural network?

Neuron : max(0, linear function of input) -> Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)

Mostly used today for Supervised Learning. Some examples:

* online ads (std NN)
* photo tagging (CNN)
* speech recognition (RNN)
* autonomous driving (RNN+)
* machine translation (Hybrid)

Applicable to both structured and unstrusctured data

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?

Benefit of large data set (with larger NN): *scale* drives DL progress

Small training sets is more dependent on feature engineering and selection than on algorithm/models.

Computation power improves

Algorithm breakthrough (also often improving computation efficiency): e.g. using ReLU instead of Sigmoid

Both allows for more iterative work
